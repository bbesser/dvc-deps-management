# A walkthrough of DVC

This is the companion repository for the article [A walkthrough of DVC](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/03/walkthrough-dvc/).

This repository contains a readily usable development environment for interactively following along with the article.
To start the development environment, clone this repository and run `./start_environment.sh bash`.
A Docker image and container will be created and you will be logged in to the container as user `dvc`, in the working folder `/home/dvc/walkthrough`.

From there, you can dive right into the fun!
